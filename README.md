# Hicoders
# The first step is we enter Git Bush
# We use the PWD command to see which file we are in.
# We create a new file with the mkdir command
# We enter the file with the cd filename command.
# Again we create 2 new files with mkdir (CSS and Preperation)
# We enter the Preperation with the cd filename command.
# Again we create 3 new files with mkdir (slides, researches and my notes)
# We enter with the cd My notes command
# We create a txt file with the echo command and write text in it.
